Our office outing to Shivapuri Village, a tranquil retreat situated 25 kilometers north of the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu Valley, on 24 May 2024, was supposed to be a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of work life. Nestled in the serene hills, Shivapuri Village is renowned for its tranquil environment and breathtaking views, making it an ideal spot for relaxation and team bonding.

The day started wonderfully, with everyone enjoying the scenic beauty, engaging in fun activities, and relishing the delicious local cuisine. The laughter and camaraderie throughout the day created a perfect atmosphere for unwinding and making memories with colleagues.

However, as night fell and we retired to our rooms, an unexpected incident disrupted the peaceful ambiance. At precisely 23:44, as I was getting ready to sleep, I felt something unusual under my pillow. To my horror, I discovered a dead rat. The shock and disgust of finding a deceased rodent in what was supposed to be a clean and comfortable bed were overwhelming. Compounding the distress, there was no electricity the whole night in the hotel, which made the situation even more uncomfortable and challenging. Additionally, there was no internet and phone network properly, further isolating us and exacerbating the discomfort.

This unsettling experience significantly marred what had been an otherwise enjoyable trip. It served as a stark reminder of the importance of cleanliness and proper maintenance in hospitality settings. Despite the picturesque location and the day's enjoyable activities, the incident left a lasting negative impression on our stay at Shivapuri Village.

While the management was apologetic and took immediate action to address the situation, the incident highlighted the need for better hygiene standards. Itâ€™s crucial for establishments like Shivapuri Village to ensure such unfortunate occurrences are prevented to maintain their reputation and guests' comfort.

Our outing to Shivapuri Village will undoubtedly be remembered, but not for the reasons we had hoped. It was a potent reminder that even in the most idyllic locations, attention to detail and cleanliness is paramount.

Thanks!
